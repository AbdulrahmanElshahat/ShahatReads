# ShahatReads

It Was Very Hard and Long Journey to reach This Final Reads App:

I sarted with The Home Page It Consists of for componants 
1. Currently Read Component
2. Want To Read Component
3.Read Component
4. Search Component (Add a Book Component)

I Built a route to each component 

All this Components Contained In a case to ease calling all of them. 

for the first three components the route leads to the shelf content so I built  from there Book shelf component
Book shelf consests of Books so I built Book component
book comonent consists of some components collected together so I Built Book Case cmponent

In search route 
I Built serch bar component which consists of two components (Back to home and search input)
also built search results component 


I added wrote all needed function to grab it all together.


Note That I wathced Multi Vedios from Alumni Projects and Visted Multi reposites and I Learned some logic from them
